# Color Picker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Component props

- `value` - current color in HEX format
- `onChange` - callback function that is executed when the color changes
- `colors` - list of colors for the drop-down menu with the given options

### Requirements

- `node.js v14.0.0+`
- `yarn v1.22.10+`

## Run in development mode

Run commands:

- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

## Create production build

Run commands:

- `yarn`
- `yarn build`

After the build command, you will get the folder `/build` with statics files.
Then `./build/index.html` is the index file of the web application and it's ready to be served
